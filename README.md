# Hi, I’m Yaw Osei Ahenkro 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in security operations, network and infrastructure security, and incident response. I hold an MSc in Cyber Security from Coventry University and a First Class BEd in Information Technology. My background combines hands-on technical projects, security analysis, and real-world experience in structured IT and enterprise environments.

I have a particular interest in:
- Security Operations (SOC) and Incident Response  
- Network Security and Infrastructure Hardening  
- Threat Detection, Vulnerability Management, and Digital Forensics  
- Applying security controls in enterprise and regulated environments  

I bring a calm, methodical, and analytical approach to problem-solving, with strong communication skills developed through teaching, student representation, and cross-team collaboration.

## 🔐 Core Projects & Experience
- **Network Traffic Forensics for IoT Botnets and DDoS Attacks (Dissertation)**  
  Designed and implemented a network forensics framework to detect and analyse IoT-based botnet and DDoS activity. This involved packet capture and inspection, traffic profiling, log analysis, and attack pattern identification using industry tools and structured methodologies.

- **Ethical Hacking & Vulnerability Assessment Projects**  
  Conducted vulnerability assessments against Windows and Linux systems using tools such as Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Nessus. Analysed findings using CVSS scoring and produced structured reports outlining risk, impact, and mitigation aligned with best practices (NIST, CIS).

- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response Labs**  
  Performed forensic investigations using Autopsy, FTK Imager, and Registry Viewer to analyse compromised systems, recover artefacts, and support incident response scenarios.

- **Security Operations & Monitoring Exercises**  
  Hands-on experience with network monitoring, packet analysis, log review, and understanding SIEM concepts, endpoint protection, and intrusion detection techniques.
