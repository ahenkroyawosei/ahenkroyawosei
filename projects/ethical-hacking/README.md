# Ethical Hacking & Vulnerability Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focused on identifying, exploiting, and reporting security vulnerabilities within a controlled lab environment. The objective was to simulate real-world attacker techniques while following ethical hacking principles, and to document findings in a clear, risk-focused manner suitable for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

The project emphasised structured reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation analysis, and professional reporting.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify vulnerabilities across Windows and Linux target systems
- Exploit misconfigurations and known weaknesses in a controlled environment
- Assess risk using industry-recognised frameworks
- Produce clear remediation-focused security reports

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Nmap** – Network discovery and service enumeration  
- **Metasploit Framework** – Exploitation and post-exploitation   
- **Kali Linux** – Attack platform  
- **CVSS** – Vulnerability severity scoring  

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Reconnaissance & Enumeration**
   - Network scanning and service identification using Nmap
   - OS and version fingerprinting

2. **Vulnerability Identification**
   - Mapping discovered services to known vulnerabilities
   - Risk evaluation using CVSS scoring

3. **Exploitation**
   - Controlled exploitation using Metasploit modules
   - Validation of exploit success and system access

4. **Post-Exploitation Analysis**
   - Reviewing system access level and potential impact
   - Identifying privilege escalation risks

5. **Reporting & Mitigation**
   - Documenting findings with evidence
   - Providing clear remediation recommendations aligned with best practices
