•	Identify vulnerabilities to evaluate their impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical systems.
•	Evaluate company business operations and customer data for cyber risks to sensitive internal systems.
•	Suggest practical methods to remediate vulnerabilities discovered and improve general security.
